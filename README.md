## 📖 Description :
On my website, the user has the option of registering for a 1,2 degree program or post-graduate studies with the chosen faculty, and setting up a student's account. In the back office panel, the website administrator has the option of reviewing the saved  candidates divided into degrees and removal of individuals. I have also added information about the school, along with the gallery, and contact details with using the API from Google Maps. I created the registration form using validation for individual fields and I added the ReCaptcha tool to protect against spam. In the form I used code sanitization and secured it against so-called "SQL injection".This website is a final project of postgraduate studies at AGH.</br></br>
